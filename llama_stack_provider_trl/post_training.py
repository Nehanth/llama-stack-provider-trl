TRL Post-Training Provider Implementation
========================================

This file contains the main implementation of the TRL (Transformer Reinforcement Learning) provider
for Llama Stack. It implements the PostTraining protocol to provide DPO (Direct Preference
Optimization) training capabilities.

Architecture Overview:
1. TrlPostTrainingImpl: Main provider class that handles requests from Llama Stack
2. Job Scheduling: Uses Scheduler to run training jobs asynchronously in separate processes
3. Training Recipes: Delegates actual training to specialized recipe classes
4. Artifact Management: Tracks checkpoints and training statistics
5. Status Monitoring: Provides real-time status updates for training jobs

Key Design Patterns:
- Protocol Implementation: Implements Llama Stack's PostTraining interface
- Async Job Management: Non-blocking training with status monitoring
- Process Isolation: Training runs in separate process to avoid memory issues
- Artifact Tracking: Structured logging of checkpoints and metrics
